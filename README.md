# My amazon clone project

I create this front end and back end (cloud functions) of Amazon with working basket, wishlist, login page, payment using stripe and so on. The technology used in this projects are :

- React
- React Context api
- React router dom
- Material Icons
- Firebase (deployment, database, cloud functions)
- Stripe (payment) @stripe/stripe-js, @stripe/react-stripe-js
- Axios
- Express for backend
- Cors

This project is still in progress, so I hope this could finish soon.
